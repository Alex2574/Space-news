    program launched its last moon mission. Luna 24 was a robotic sample return
    mission and the third of its kind. It lifted off on a Proton-K rocket from the
    Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and safety landed on the lunar surface nine
    days later. The probe landed in a dark plain known as Mare Crisium, or the
    "Sea of Crises" and collected 6 ounces (170.1 grams) of soil samples, which it
    brought back to Earth on Aug. 22, 1976. Scientists then found that the samples
    from Luna 24 contained tiny traces of water â€” about 0.1 percent by mass. 21
